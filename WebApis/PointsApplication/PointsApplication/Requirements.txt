Welcome to Web Apis

I want you to create a Rest Web api for storing Points (like in coordinates)
Point has x and y.

I should be able to:
Add new point
Get a single point
Get all points
Delete a point

Extra: when creating Assign point to a point-list
get points by list (filtering):
1. We have separate resource: we can create and delete pointlist
2. When creating new point we can specify the pointlist id
3. /pointlist/3/Point/ should return the points.

Non-function requirement: Controller -> Services -> Repositories -> dbContext

1. C# asp.net web api
2. What is restfull api.
3. What is a Postman, how can it help in api development?
4. What is swagger?
5. What is HttpGet,HttpPost,HttpDelete
6. FromUrl vs FromBody
